# AnkiCustomSnippets

Doesn't yet work. An Anki add-on to define custom snippets, to aid myself in adding MathJax expressions.

Update 2021/01/02: I no longer have a need for this, as I use [Mathpix Snip](https://mathpix.com/) to quickly add equation cards. I'll leave it public, though, in case anyone wants to use it as a starting point.
